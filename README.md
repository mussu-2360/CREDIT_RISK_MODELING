# CREDIT_RISK_MODELING
The project aims to develop a credit risk model using customer data to predict whether or not to grant a loan. This involves analyzing various attributes such as income, employment status, credit history, and other relevant factors to assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on the loan. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model will provide insights into the creditworthiness of applicants, helping financial institutions make informed decisions and mitigate potential risks associated with lending.
